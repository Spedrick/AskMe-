A practice project for learning to use Wolframalpha api.
  
   The [Wolfram|Alpha Webservice](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) API provides a web-based API allowing the computational and presentation capabilities of Wolfram|Alpha to be integrated into web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise applications. Wolfram Alpha is an API which can compute expert-level answers using Wolframâ€™s algorithms, knowledgebase and AI technology. It is made possible by the Wolfram Language. This article tells how to create a simple assistant application in Python which can answer simple questions

# Prerequisite: Basic understanding of python syntax and functions.
1. Wolf ram alpha api:-
```
  pip install wolframalpha
```
2. Wolf ram alpha API Id.




# Getting API Id

Create a account at Wolfram alpha. The account can be created at the [official website](https://account.wolfram.com/auth/create).
After signing up, sign in using your Wolfram ID.
Now you will see the homepage of the website. 
Head to the section in the top right corner where you see your email. 
In the drop down menu, select the My Apps (API) option.


# Output:-
```
Enter your api_id:-######-##########
Question: integration of sinxcosx
integral sin(x) cos(x) dx = -1/2 cos^2(x) + constant
Question: exit
Good Bye!!!
